In this directory, the analysis increment (analysis minus background) will be plotted.
The input is netcdf analysis and first_guess file.
There are five scripts to plot the cross section from different ways,which were initially
developed to plot the increment from single obs test.
Just run plot_inc.sh which will plot all five increments for you but you need to set some
parameters in plot_inc.sh to tell the scripts which level to be plotted.
